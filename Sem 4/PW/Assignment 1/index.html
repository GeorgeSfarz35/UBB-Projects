<p>A disc jockey, more commonly abbreviated as DJ, is a person who plays recorded music for an audience. Most common types of DJs include radio DJs, club DJs (who work at a nightclub or music festival), mobile DJs (who are hired to work at public and private events such as weddings , parties, or festivals), and turntablists (who use record players, usually turntables, to manipulate sounds on phonograph records). Originally, the "disc" in "disc jockey" referred to shellac and later vinyl records, but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who mix music from other recording media such as cassettes, CDs or digital audio files on a CDJ, controller, or even a laptop. DJs may adopt the title "DJ" in front of their real names, adopted pseudonyms, or stage names.</p>

<p>It is recomended to start with just a mixing controller and a set of headphones.First of all it is more affordable,and also this gives you the oportunity to focus on learning the technique without having to worry too much about all the functionalities on more complicated equipment.It is just enough to get you started.Usually,if you are using a controller,you also have to connect it to a laptop or a PC along with a mixing program in order to power it up, acces the music library,and to have visual support of what you are actually doing.There are some bigger controllers that have an incorporated screen and mixing program,so they can work on their own,with just an USB stick needed to acces your music library.</p>

<p>Sound is a form of energy, just like electricity and light. A sound is made when air molecules vibrate and move in a pattern called waves, or sound waves.When a wave is created, the distance between one compression and the next compression is called the wavelength. The faster the sound waves pass a given point, the shorter the wavelength and the higher the frequency.The frequency of sound is measured in Hertz(Hz).The human range of hearing is roughly from 20 Hz to 20000 Hz,or 20 kHz.</p>
